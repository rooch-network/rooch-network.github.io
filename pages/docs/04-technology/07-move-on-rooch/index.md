# Why Move?

[Move](https://github.com//move-language/move) is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts originally developed at Facebook to power the Diem blockchain. Move is designed to be a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across diverse blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. 

There are already a several Layer1s using Move, such as [Starcoin](https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin), [0L](https://github.com/OLSF/libra), [Aptos](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core), [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui), and there are several upcoming and existing platforms planning to integrate the Move language.


It has several key features that make it well suited as a programming language for smart contract in the execution layer as well as in the state channel.

1. It is easy to implement [Account Abstraction](02-account-abstraction.md). And account abstraction is important for supporting multi-chain account models, and for Web3.
2. It enables [state scaling](../06-state-scaling.md) for Layer1 by implementing a resource-oriented programming model via linear types that can migrate the state from Layer1 to the execution layer.
3. Its stateless contract model enables cross-layer reuse of smart contracts, thus enabling seamless [cross-layer interoperability](01-cross-layer-interoperability.md). 
4. Its state model is [parallel execution](../05-parallel-transaction-execution.md) friendly, which can provide higher throughput execution layers.

## MoveOS and Rooch Framework

* [MoveOS](04-moveos.md) provides a multi-chain compatible Move execution environment.
* [RoochFramework](03-rooch-framework.md) provides account abstraction and cross-layer contracts.
