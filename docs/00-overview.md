# Overview 

Rooch is a **Move Execution layer** that connects Multi-Chains to Web3. It provides **scalability** for public chains, **Move execution environment** and **settlement protocol** for Web3 applications.

The name **Rooch** is a shortcut for **Root & Branch**, which was the first name of a magazine, also used for a beer. We thought the name was a good representation of the Rooch's position in the ecosystem.

**Chain** is the root, **DApp** is the branch, and **Rooch** connects **Root** and **Branch**.

1. [Why Rooch?](01-why-rooch.md) This document answers this question from the perspective of current public chains scaling solutions and the requirements of Web3 applications.
2. [What is Rooch?](02-what-is-rooch.md) This document explains the key features of Rooch.
3. If you want to learn more about How Rooch is worked, you can read the chapter [Technical Architecture](04-technology/index.md) to learn about its technical implementation.
