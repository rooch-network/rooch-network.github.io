## Rooch's Development Progress

### New characteristic

- Support for transaction signature verification for Ethereum with Metamask in #241(opens in a new tab).

### Improvements and fixes

- In [#220](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/pull/220) completed optimization refactoring of `cli`, `server`, `testsuite`, added client config, added `ServerConfig` (default), added `WalletContext` to CLI.
- Completed MoveOS VM and Session refactoring in [#242](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/pull/242).
- In [#246](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/pull/246), the variable `tnx` representing the transaction is uniformly renamed to `tx`.
- Replace `Result` with `VMResult`, `PartialVMResult` and refactor `verify_entry_function` for more complete error information.
