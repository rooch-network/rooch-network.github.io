# Streaming payment

Transactions in a state channel requires only participants confirmation, so its throughput is limited only by the network bandwidth between participant nodes, so it makes streaming or micropayments possible.

When we use paid Web services, the longer the payment period to the service provider, the more we rely on trust on the service provider and the higher the risk of fraud we face. If we split the payment granularity small enough, for example, pay per byte for downloading files, or pay per request for RPC services, the risk to the user is small enough.

And this kind of frequency of payment cannot be achieved through traditional payment methods, but only through the state channel. And this kind of payment method really realizes the on-demand payment, and we think the future applications and services should be paid on-demand.
