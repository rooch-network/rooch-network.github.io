If the sequencer cannot be decentralized, on the one hand, there is a single point of risk that the whole network will be unavailable when the sequencer is down, and on the other hand, there is also the risk of sequencer fraud. Before transactions are written in batches to the data availability layer and the consensus layer, the sequencer can fraud by dropping transactions or adjusting the order of transactions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technology/fraud-proofs":{"id":"technology/fraud-proofs","title":"Fraud Proofs","description":"Fraud Proof is the most critical part of the Layer2 project to ensure security.

In Rooch, we need to support multiple settlement layers to ensure that multiple Layer1 accounts can be mapped to Rooch accounts, so we need the Account Abstraction to achieve this.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technology/move-on-rooch/cross-layer-interoperability":{"id":"technology/move-on-rooch/cross-layer-interoperability","title":"Cross Layer Interoperability","description":"Cross-layer interoperability is one of the challenges in a layered solution, and the following solutions for cross-layer interaction are provided in Rooch.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"technology/move-on-rooch/index":{"id":"technology/move-on-rooch/index","title":"Why Move?","description":"Move is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts originally developed at Facebook to power the Diem blockchain.
